## üß≠ Overview

Coffeeto addresses the issue of opaque pricing in the coffee industry. Despite the growing awareness and scrutiny of prices like oil and cryptocurrencies, consumers often overlook the pricing transparency of everyday products like coffee. This project aims to shed light on coffee pricing by providing an API that offers transparent and real-time information about coffee prices, similar to how oil and cryptocurrency prices are tracked.

## üö© Problem: Why does my cup of coffee cost so much?

The cost of coffee has significantly increased, with people now spending an average of $6 for a beverage at cafes and grocery stores: bean prices have climbed 22% in the last three years. This price surge is due to a combination of changing weather patterns, international turmoil, elevated energy costs, inflation, and labor shortages. Despite these rising costs, the complex process of producing and delivering high-quality coffee justifies the price, as each cup reflects the efforts of farmers, processors, and baristas. - By Rachel Lerman and Emily Wright, The Washington Post.

## üç™ Solution

I opted for transparency in coffee pricing as the guiding principle for my approach. To achieve this, I integrated the Arabista Coffee price API from Bloomberg for Data Viz, supplemented by a fictitious coffee API for visual reinforcement. Additionally, I incorporated the Realtime Commodities API to offer a more comprehensive context. The links to all APIs utilized are provided below for reference.

## üéØ Features

1. **Promote Transparency**: Establish an easily accessible platform showcasing real-time coffee prices, enabling consumers to grasp the factors shaping their coffee's cost.
2. **Encourage Ethical Spending**: Enlighten consumers about the significance of ethical expenditure on everyday products, fostering awareness and responsible purchasing habits.
3. **Develop a Reliable API Infrastructure**: Utilize validated APIs to retrieve and exhibit authentic coffee prices and pertinent commodity information, ensuring reliability and accuracy.
4. **Foster an Ethical Ecosystem**: Create an e-commerce platform offering ethically sourced coffee, facilitating direct connections between farmers and brewers to establish a sustainable and inclusive ecosystem.
